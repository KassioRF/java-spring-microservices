### Issues

- Use clear and concise titles.  
- Add labels when applicable (e.g., `bug`, `enhancement`, `question`).  
- The issue body should include:
  - Problem or suggestion description
  - Business rules or requirements (if applicable)
  - Steps to reproduce (for bugs)
  - Screenshots or logs, if relevant



### Pull Requests

- Keep PRs small and focused on a single purpose.  
- The title should follow the same format as commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, etc).  
- In the PR description, include:
  - Reference to related issues (e.g., `Closes #12`)
  - Explanation of what and why the changes were made
  - Testing instructions, if necessary  
- Mark as *draft* if still in progress (`[WIP]`).
